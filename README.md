## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Database and Authentication Setup (Supabase)
We use Supabase for free, secure, and scalable backend infrastructure.
1. **Create a Free Project**: Head to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a free tier project.
2. **Execute Schema**: In your project's **SQL Editor**, paste and run these files **in this order** (each shows a success message):
   1. `database/schema.sql` — core platform (students, staff, fees, RLS…)
   2. `database/voting-schema.sql` — voting & polls
   3. `database/cbt-schema.sql` — the CBT / online-exam engine
   4. `database/reportcard-schema.sql` — flexible report cards (auto-links CBT results)
   5. `database/enterprise-schema.sql` — timetable generator, QR check-in, diary, surveys, menu, 2FA, i18n
3. **Get Credentials**: Go to Project Settings → API and copy your **Project URL** and **anon public key**.
4. **Link Frontend**: Open `assets/js/config.js` and replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your copied values.

### Step 2: Hosting and Build Process
This platform supports the build type you selected during generation: **TRADITIONAL**.

**Traditional Build Workflow (Static Hosting):**
1. **Deployment Platform**: You can host this instantly on platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
2. **Upload Files**: Simply drag and drop or push the entire directory contents to your chosen platform.
3. **No Build Step Required**: Since this is purely static (HTML/CSS/JS), it serves immediately without any build configuration.

### Step 3: Admin Initialization
1. Visit the deployed site in your browser.
2. Click **Sign in to Portal** and choose **Request access** to register an account.
3. Head back to the Supabase SQL Editor and elevate your newly created user to an admin by running:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles SET role='admin', status='approved' WHERE email='your-email@example.com';
   ```
4. You can now log in, access the dashboard, and begin approving staff and students directly from the **Directory** or **Staff** modules.

## 🌐 HMG Academy Ecosystem
This platform is a proud part of the **HMG Academy Ecosystem**. It's optimized for lead generation, pointing prospective clients and students to [HMG Concepts](https://hmgconcepts.pages.dev/). The software stays free forever, with robust architecture preventing any dependency on paid AI APIs or costly third-party services.


## School Connect v1 Final Deployment Note
Run `database/complete-schema.sql` once in Supabase SQL Editor for a fresh deployment. It is now cumulative and self-contained: it includes base schema, CBT, voting, report cards, enterprise tables, class fee structures, product store, status audit log, parent-child access policies, staff check-in deadline settings, and schema-cache reload notifications. Versioned SQL files are historical references only; the current complete schema already includes them.

## School Connect V5.1 definitive CBT repair

The historical V5.1 repair documentation is in `docs/v5/`. In V5.6.1, fresh and existing projects run only the full `database/complete-schema.sql`; it includes the zero-score repair. Frontend-only deployment is insufficient. No paid AI API is used.

## School Connect V5.3 update

V5.3 adds teacher-owned profile signatures on assigned class reports, controlled full CBT editing, adaptive CBT-only report cards, a four-step timetable wizard and the demo numeric-amount correction. Back up and run the latest `database/complete-schema.sql`, then deploy all files and hard-refresh. See `docs/v5/V5.3-TEACHER-CBT-TIMETABLE-DEMO.md`.

## School Connect V5.4 update

V5.4 adds re-importable paginated portable archives, local archive analysis, export-before-purge, an orderly session/term CBT library with archive/restore, adaptive CBT-only reports and beginning-of-term student physical metrics. Back up and run the latest `database/complete-schema.sql`, deploy all files and hard-refresh. See `docs/v5/V5.4-PORTABILITY-CBT-ORGANIZATION-METRICS.md`.

## School Connect V5.5 update

V5.5 adds fully dynamic admin-defined report headings/maxima, admission-only registered CBT identity, password recovery, consistent navigation icons, comprehensive per-page assistant guidance, clearer Rubrics/Transcripts and term/session academic-performance insights. Back up and run the latest `database/complete-schema.sql`, deploy all files, configure the Supabase recovery redirect and hard-refresh. See `docs/v5/V5.5-FLEXIBLE-REPORTS-REGISTERED-CBT-RECOVERY-INSIGHTS.md`.

## School Connect V5.6.1 — one complete schema and SQL repairs

V5.6.1 makes `database/complete-schema.sql` the only production SQL path. It
contains all V5.1–V5.6.1 objects, has one authoritative definition per function,
ends with a self-sufficiency check and is verified by executing it twice. Do not
run focused/versioned SQL after it; only a separate demo project additionally runs
`demo-users.sql` and `demo-seed.sql`.

The release fixes open/multi-subject CBT failing with `record "s" is not assigned
yet` and demo seeding failing with PostgreSQL `42702 exam_id is ambiguous`.
Registered identity enforcement remains intact. Deploying frontend files without
rerunning the complete schema is insufficient.

See `docs/v5/V5.6.1-COMPLETE-SCHEMA-CBT-DEMO-SQL-FIX.md`.

## School Connect V5.7 final professional audit

V5.7 adds institutional principal/proprietor/examination-officer Drive signatures
with background removal, editable/deletable public examination campaigns, enhanced
custom documents, performance-based bulk report comments, separated leadership
navigation and registered-value dropdowns. Back up and run only the full updated
`database/complete-schema.sql`, deploy every file and hard-refresh. See
`docs/v5/V5.7-FINAL-PROFESSIONAL-AUDIT-AND-ENHANCEMENTS.md`.
