# Database installation

Run **`complete-schema.sql`** once in the Supabase SQL Editor. It is the single,
self-contained, dependency-ordered, idempotent v12 schema for a **fresh** deployment —
and it also **repairs** older School Connect databases (missing tables, columns, unique
keys, policies) without touching your data.

> **Self-sufficiency contract (v12.5):** apart from the two optional demo packs
> (`demo-users.sql`, `demo-seed.sql` — demo deployments only), `complete-schema.sql`
> is the **ONLY** SQL a School Connect deployment ever needs. Every table,
> constraint, index, policy, trigger, view and **every RPC the client code calls**
> (all 16, machine-enumerated) is inside it. The standalone packs below exist
> **only** to bring *already-live* older projects up to date without a full re-run.

Files:
- `complete-schema.sql` — **run this** (currently **v12.5**; ends with PostgREST cache reload).
- `complete-schema-v12-clean.sql` — identical named copy (kept byte-in-sync with `complete-schema.sql`).
- `complete-schema-v11-LEGACY-MERGED.sql` — historical reference only; do NOT run on new projects.
- `*.csv` — import templates & sample question banks.

- `demo-users.sql` / `demo-seed.sql` — demo-deployment guest accounts + simulated school (see DEMO-SETUP.md in a demo ZIP).
- `cbt-1000-scale.sql` — **optional additive pack** for projects already on v12.x: idempotent CBT submissions (client_ref), the v2 exam-fetch/submit functions and hot-path indexes so **1000 students can write one exam simultaneously**. Included inside `complete-schema.sql` from v12.3 onward, so fresh installs already have it.
- `punctuality-points.sql` — **optional additive pack** for projects already on v12.1–v12.3: the **Punctuality Points engine** (daily punctuality awards from student check-in/out data, plus the optional one-click push of term points into `results`). Included inside `complete-schema.sql` from v12.4 onward, so fresh installs already have it.
- `runtime-helper-rpcs.sql` — **optional additive pack** for projects already on ≤v12.4: the nine runtime helper RPCs the client references (`sc_current_role`, `lookup_login_email`, `notif_mark_read`, `table_sizes`, `purge_old`, `submit_admission`, `extract_admission`, `generate_timetable`, `cbt_import_backup`) plus the `admissions` `photo_url/data/extracted` column-gap fix. Included inside `complete-schema.sql` from v12.5 onward, so fresh installs already have it. Safe to re-run any number of times (pure no-op on v12.5+).

## v12.5 patch — runtime-RPC contract completion + self-sufficiency (2026-07-23)
Section 18 ships every RPC the client code can call, so **no deployment ever needs a
secondary SQL file or a hand-created dashboard function again**: `sc_current_role()`
(one-call profile/role fetch), `lookup_login_email(identifier)` (sign in with email,
phone, admission no or staff no), `notif_mark_read(id)` (idempotent per-user read
receipts), `table_sizes()` (storage meter incl. `TOTAL_DATABASE_USED` row),
`purge_old(table, days)` (whitelist-guarded admin cleanup), `submit_admission(jsonb)`
(apply-form intake), `extract_admission(id)` (one click admission → student, with the
auto `SCH-00001` admission-number trigger), `generate_timetable(class, session, term,
periods/day)` (weekday round-robin from `timetable_requirements`, replace-clean
regeneration — an infinite-loop flaw in the first draft was caught by the harness and
fixed), and `cbt_import_backup(jsonb)` (teacher-side import of offline exam backups:
same server-authoritative, shuffle-safe grading as `cbt_submit_v2`, minus the
exam-window/attempt gates, idempotent on `client_ref`). Section 18.0 also force-adds
the `admissions.photo_url / data / extracted` columns older schemas silently lacked.
Also hardened this round: the question-source selector used by
`cbt_get_public_exam`, `cbt_submit`, `cbt_get_public_exam_v2`, `cbt_submit_v2` and
`cbt_import_backup` now picks the first **non-empty** bank
(`csv_data` → `questions` → `[]`) instead of a bare `coalesce`, which could never
reach the legacy `questions` column (it is `NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'`). Legacy
questions-only exams now render and grade correctly end-to-end. Grants are
least-privilege (`revoke … from public, anon` / `grant … to authenticated`;
`lookup_login_email` additionally granted to `anon` because login happens pre-auth).
All client call sites keep their graceful fallbacks, so these functions are pure
hardening on older client builds and instantly live on new ones. For live projects
already on ≤v12.4, run `database/runtime-helper-rpcs.sql` once — same content,
standalone, idempotent.

## v12.4 patch — Punctuality Points engine + results-columns fix (2026-07-23)
Section 17 of the schema ships the punctuality engine: `punctuality_config`
(editable rule: first check-in ≤ deadline AND last checkout ≥ closing → points),
`punctuality_awards` (unique per student+date, re-gradeable),
`compute_punctuality_awards(date, class)` and
`sc_push_punctuality_to_results(term, session, column, class, range)` — an
IDEMPOTENT upsert into `results` (deterministic `assessment_ref`,
information_schema-validated numeric column, manual rows never matched). This
run also force-adds the four enhanced `results` columns (`student_id_ref`,
`student_name`, `assessment_source`, `assessment_ref`) + `results_assessment_uidx`,
fixing a latent 42703 the punctuality/CTB pushes could hit on databases installed
fresh from earlier v12.x builds. For live projects already on v12.1–v12.3, run
`database/punctuality-points.sql` once — same content, standalone.

## v12.3 patch — CBT 1000-concurrent scale pack (2026-07-23)
Section 16 of the schema now ships the scale pack: submissions are IDEMPOTENT
(a retry after a network drop returns the original result instead of a
duplicate), grading stays 100% server-side and is shuffle-safe (graded by each
question's `_orig_index`, not screen position), attempt limits and the exam
close-window are enforced by the database, and the exam page syncs its clock to
the server. The client needs no changes and falls back to the v1 functions on
older schemas. For live projects already on v12.1/v12.2, run
`database/cbt-1000-scale.sql` once — same content, standalone.

## v12.1 patch — 42703 "column student_id does not exist" (2026-07-22)
If you saw `ERROR: 42703: column "student_id" does not exist` while running
`complete-schema.sql` on an EXISTING database, your database was built by an
older schema generation whose tables (e.g. `support_plans`, `certificates`,
`lms_submissions`, `idcards`, `results.teacher_id`, `poll_votes.candidate_id`,
`profiles.role/status`, …) pre-date the hardening added in v12. RLS policies
validate their column references at creation time, so the run aborted.
v12.1 extends the drift-hardening block: every column referenced by any
policy / view / function / constraint / index is now force-added
(`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`) before first use. Just re-run the updated
`complete-schema.sql` — it is idempotent and purely additive; nothing is
dropped from your database.
